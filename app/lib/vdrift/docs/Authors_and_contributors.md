VDrift was created by [Joe Venzon](http://vdrift.net/Forum/member.php?action=profile&uid=1) who continues to fix bugs in the game, as well as writing new subsystems and maintaining old ones. Joe created everything in VDrift which is not attributed to someone else below.

The physics engine in the game was originally [Vamos Automotive Simulator](http://vamos.sourceforge.net/), written by Sam Varner. As time went on it underwent many modifications. Now, the physics system has been rewritten.

### Code

-   [NaN](http://vdrift.net/Forum/member.php?action=profile&uid=4879) has rewritten the physics code, added car color selection, implemented multi-language menus, and continues to fix bugs and add new features.
-   [Chris Guirl](http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=4) set up the web sites and the Subversion repositories, and is also to blame for the SCons build scripts, XS model, some miscellaneous graphics, much of the GUI system, bug fixes and reports, documentation, testing, support, and generally annoying Joe. Chris is currently working on a driver training system with evaluation of driving behavior and driver feedback.
-   [Francis Whittle](http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=1435) has improved the car suspension by adding new types of suspension.
-   [Antonio Caiazzo](http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=5534) is working on a new AI system based on neural networks.

### Game Data

Most of the imported cars and tracks had several authors to begin with, too many to list here. Thanks to them anyway, and in general to [Racer-Xtreme](http://www.racer-xtreme.com/) and the [Racer community](http://www.racer.nl/) at [Race Sim Central](http://www.rscnet.org/).

#### Tracks

-   [alex25](http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=412) has imported most of the tracks from various sources, and helped maintain them over time.

#### Cars

-   [Ny Dedes](http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=1337) TC6, LE, and is working on a new car, the ATT. also modeled the driver, and coded the mesh generation for tires and brake rotors.
-   [Timothy Porter](http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=3407) is working on preparing freely-licensed car models for import, and polishing the track Rouen.

### Ports

-   [Julian Mayer](http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=140) maintains the VDrift port for Mac OS X.
-   [Timothy Furlong](http://vdrift.net/Forum/member.php?action=profile&uid=2097) helps maintain the VDrift port for Mac OS X and has helped to update and expand wiki pages.
-   [Jose Alonso Cardenas Marquez](http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=167) maintains the VDrift port for FreeBSD.

-   [rookie1](http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=755) wrote the automatic shifting code, and the entire artificial intelligence system. He's also fixed a few bugs here and there, and made some improvements to the track editor.
-   [MirceaKitsune](http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=5095) contributed new skins for several cars, and several patches including adding reverse lights, sounds for gear, brake and handbrake, and a new car coloring implementation with adapted skins.
-   [cotharyus](http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=710) improved the car specifications for many models using research done on the internet, as well as play testing.
-   [Matthew Nicholson](http://vdrift.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=197) helped with testing and debugging, worked on Debian GNU/Linux packaging, and improved the build system.
