VDrift has a high quality simulation engine and graphics so needs a fairly decent computer for it to run the best it can. The following hardware requirements are what can be reasonable expect to have no problems playing the game, but we don't have a comprehensive test suite so feel free to test VDrift on your own computer and tell us the results!

Processor
---------

VDrift requires a relatively fast CPU. A 2 GHz or better clock speed is recommended, although it should be possible to run VDrift with a 1 GHz or better CPU.

Graphics
--------

VDrift requires an OpenGL 2.0 capable graphics card, OpenGL 3.3 is recommended.

A nVidia GeForce 8 Series or ATI Radeon HD 4800 Series card is recommended in order to enjoy all visual effects. By reducing or disabling some of the [display options](Configuring_the_display.md), it should be possible to play VDrift with a nVidia GeForce 6 or ATI Radeon 9000.

You should install newest version of the device drivers for your graphics card.

Memory
------

VDrift can consume about 300 MB of memory on a typical run so 512 MB is the minimum requirement but 1 GB or more is recommended, especially for larger tracks.

Storage
-------

The basic [release](Downloading.md) is usually about 650 MB, so you must have at least 700 MB free space before you begin, and more if you wish to add more cars or tracks. While the source code is less than 30 MB, if you [get the development version](Getting_the_development_version.md) you will need at least 2.5 GB as the data repository is about 1.7 GB, you will need to download dependencies as well (up to 60 MB depending on your operating system), and space is needed for build files.

You should also check you have enough bandwidth to download these amounts - some ISPs have download limits.

Platforms
---------

VDrift is known to compile on:

-   32-bit x86
-   64-bit x86
-   PowerPC

Operating Systems
-----------------

Ports for VDrift are available for these operating systems:

-   Windows
-   OS X (10.4 "Tiger" or higher required)
-   Linux
-   FreeBSD
